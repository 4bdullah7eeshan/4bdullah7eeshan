# Abdullah Zeeshan

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

My name is Abdullah Zeeshan, and I am a passionate Full Stack Developer from Hyderabad, India. Before diving into tech, I worked as a Math educator with various educational organizations, such as NGOs, schools, and ed-tech startups.

## Background

My journey into the world of technology began in my late teens when I developed a keen interest in coding, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I wrote my first `hello, world` program while taking Harvard's [CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) course which laid the groundwork for my understanding of computer science fundamentals.

A few years later, I discovered [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) and it's [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/), where I built my first image classifier with nearly 100% accuracy. However, I realized that while I was excited about deep learning, I lacked foundational skills in software development. To bridge this gapâ€”and to ensure both learning and employabilityâ€”I decided to first become proficient as a developer. 

Thatâ€™s when I stumbled upon [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). Over the past year, this incredible resource has been my guide, marking the start of my self-directed journey to becoming a Full Stack Developer. It has provided me with the essential skills and knowledge to build robust applications and confidently navigate the tech world.

Now, Iâ€™ve fallen in love with web development, and I plan to stay in this space for the next few years, honing my skills, building impactful projects, and growing as a developer. In the future, I aspire to revisit my passion for deep learning, combining my web development expertise with cutting-edge AI technologies to create meaningful solutions.

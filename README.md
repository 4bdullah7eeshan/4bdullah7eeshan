# Abdullah Zeeshan

- 👋 Oh joy, it's @4bdullah7eeshan. How utterly original.
- 👀 Currently obsessed with Web Development and Deep Learning—because we all need more people like me in the world.
- 🌱 Currently slogging through Web Development lessons from The Odin Project. It’s not like there are a million other people doing the same thing.
- 💞️ Desperately seeking collaborators on Web Development projects—if you’re as bored as I am.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out if you’re also wasting your life.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him, because clearly that’s the most exciting part of my identity.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I still haven't figured out why any of this matters.
